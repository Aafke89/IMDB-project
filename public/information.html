    <p>In the last few weeks I made several small things that all ended up in my final project: "Visualizing my favourite movies". The four links that you could find on the previous page show my progress. I will shortly go in about them.</p>
    <p>About two months ago I made an page where you could find some information about the moviehouses in Amterdam. I used D3 to show it in a barchart and tried to use firebase but didn't succeed. </p>
    <p>After the break we learned to use webcomponents. I made 4 webcomponents to grasp how to use several parts of a page, like the innerHTML, information from an infobox etc. I also tried to add some interactivity.</p>
    <p>With the IMDB-elements I tried to use the IMDB-api with succes</p>
    <p>In my final project I used a lot of stuff. I made use of a server on my own computer from which I now and then committed changes to github. I made a succesfull connection with firebase not only putting information in, but also get some information out. There is a lot of interactivity, people can add movies, choose on which detaill they wanna focus, filter/search for a certain actor/genre/director etc. I tried some new functions of CSS. </p>
    <p>Overall I think I learned a lot from this course, far more than I could imagine in the beginning. Of course there are a lot of things that could use some improvements. Especially with the webcomponents I had sometimes some difficulties to integrate them, I found it difficult to use them as more then seperate parts on a page. Furthermore the CSS could use some more professionality. Also some functions could be more clearly structured, while I now almost copy pasted some. Luckily I will not stop after this course, so i hope I can learn more and more by just doing it.</p>
